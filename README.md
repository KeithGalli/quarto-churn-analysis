# Telecom Churn Analysis

Given a dataset of customer information from a Telecom company, can we analyze why customers left?

## Project Info

The data in this repo comes from a popular [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn). A copy of this data can be found in [telco-customer-churn.csv](./telco-customer-churn.csv)

## Creating Analytics Reports from Jupyter Notebooks

In a video posted on Posit's YouTube channel, you will see how to quickly convert a Jupyter Notebook to an Analytics Report (HTML).

The starting code can be found in [analysis.ipynb](./analysis.ipynb) & the final code can be found in [report.ipynb](./report.ipynb)

The output report can be found on Posit Connect Cloud using [this link](https://01936b5c-737c-c821-3855-5fefdd8d8b5c.share.connect.posit.cloud/)
